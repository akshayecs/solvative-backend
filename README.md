steps how can you just use it and at how much level it is working


clone this repo

add your credentials in .env file

npm i

npm start

your server starts on PORT localhost: 3000

now hit the endpoint on the browser it will show you the template (UI)
http://localhost:3000/

now type something like example as: delhi or Ahmedabad in the search box and hit enter it will show you some results in the table:

due to some internet issue i left this app at least on the working mode as mentioned in the task description otherwise if i could have some more time i could do that better and i think other features like showing messages appropriateyly for not found and stat saerching that need to do in it.
